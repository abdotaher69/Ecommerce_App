I'm excited to share a project I've been working on: a complete e-commerce solution with a dedicated admin panel! 🛍

Built from the ground up using Flutter for a beautiful, cross-platform user experience and Firebase for a scalable, real-time backend. 
The system includes a dynamic product catalog, shopping cart functionality,
and a robust admin panel for seamless order and inventory management.
🏠 Home: Modern and clean layout.

📂 Categories: Easy navigation through different fashion collections.

🛒 Cart: Simple and efficient order management.

👤 Profile: Personalized user experience.

🎨 The app follows a brand-inspired theme with custom colors to enhance the visual identity and deliver a consistent look & feel
